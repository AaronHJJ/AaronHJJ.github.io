<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;"> Hi! I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics (IORA), National University of Singapore (NUS). Trained initially at Sun Yat-sen University, and later refined at Department of Analytics and Operations (DAO) and IORA at NUS, I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Chung-Piaw Teo](https://www.teochungpiaw.com/) and [Prof. Fan Wang](https://bus.sysu.edu.cn/en/teacher/WangFan) and [Prof. Mabel C.Chou](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/people-p/mabel-chou/). I also work closely with  [Prof. Zhou Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/xuzhou) and [Prof. Zhenzhen Yan](https://sites.google.com/view/zhenzhenyan/home). </span>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;">My research is rooted in **Smart and Data-driven Aviation Operations Management** and **Logistics and Supply Chain Management**, with a strong emphasis on applying data-driven optimization, deep learning and empirical analysis. Recently, driven by a keen interest in geospatial analytics, I have been actively exploring a new research frontier—**leveraging remote sensing technologies for operations management and disaster response applications**. This integrated research agenda has led to the development of several practical systems, including:</span> 

- (1) the [Joint Prediction and Optimization (JPO) system](http://172.18.168.44:9000/) for demand forecasting and inventory control, with beta v1.0 launched on August 29, 2024, for internal use at NUS and in undergraduate teaching.
- (2) the [LogXHub system](https://appbyjinjiahuang.shinyapps.io/Demo1_DynamicPlanningSystemforCrossDockingOperations_Beta_v9/) to optimize buffer inventory and enhance dynamic cross-docking operations at hubs.
-  (3) the [Critical Global Trade Analytics Dashboard](http://appiora.nus.edu.sg/scdashboard/), developed in collaboration with PSA Singapore, to monitor and enhance supply chain resilience for key import/export commodities such as semiconductors.

[**Research**] <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We study the use of registered volunteers to re-position empty bikes for riders in a bike sharing system.
- We solve a transshipment network design model to account for random route demand and construct a sparse structure that limits volunteer re-balancing to essential routes.
- This provide new insights into the performance of sparse structures in bike re-balancing, showing that concentrating flows reduces redundant moves significantly with minimal impact on demand satisfaction.

- We develop a novel network design model for process flexibility systems with agent choice, leveraging conic programming and distributionally robust optimization. 
- We provide arguably the first study on constructing sparse networks in decentralized settings with choice behavior.
- We reveal a paradoxical phenomenon: sometimes, <em> less (choices) can be more (efficient)</em>. We provide new sights into the value of sparse structures.

[**Research**] <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We address the fundamental resource assignment problem faced by hub operators managing multiple services with scheduled starting and completion times, accounting for uncertain delays revealed over time.
- We derive a new insight that conflicts and crossings are equivalent under worst-case delay realization.
- This provides the first theoretical explanation, from the perspective of (distributionally) robust optimization for the good performance of the buffering approach in minimizing both crossings and conflicts in the
operations.

- We aim at improving dynamic cross-docking at hubs, such as Singapore's port free-trade zone, in collaboration with IDSC consultancy.
- We use a semi-definite programming (SDP) model to optimize buffer inventory, addressing uncertainties in arrival sequences, supply, and demand, thereby streamlining cross-docking.
- Our work leads to the development of the [LogXHub system](https://appbyjinjiahuang.shinyapps.io/Demo1_DynamicPlanningSystemforCrossDockingOperations_Beta_v9/).

[**Research & Project**] <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We explore the use of a class of Graph Neural Network (GNN) in modeling and exploiting the correlated demand patterns in multiple time series data. 
- We describe an application of GNN approach on a printer service management problem posed by an industry collaborator.
- This project leads to the development of the Joint Prediction and Optimization (JPO) system for demand forecasting and inventory control. The JPO system beta v1.0 was launched on August 29, 2024, for
internal use at NUS and has been used in undergraduate course teaching exercises.
- We provide the novel insight that GNNs might benefit from the data pooling effect inherent to a statistical phenomenon.

- We study the impact of third-party grocery delivery adoption on retail operations using a stylized model, store-level transaction data (in the hundreds of millions), and a DiD synthetic control method.
- We reveal that platform entry significantly increases sales dispersion, reduces popular product sales and volume, while leaving revenue unchanged.
- We derive a new insight that applying inventory pooling to account for sales dispersion changes can improve warehouse-level ordering decisions and mitigate stock imbalances.
