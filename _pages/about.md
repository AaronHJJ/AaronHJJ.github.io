<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;">I am a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute of Operations Research and Analytics (IORA), National University of Singapore. I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Chung-Piaw Teo](https://www.teochungpiaw.com/) and [Prof. Mabel C.Chou](https://iora.nus.edu.sg/people-p/mabel-chou/). I also work closely with [Prof. Zhou Xu](https://sites.google.com/view/xuzhou) and [Prof. Zhenzhen Yan](https://sites.google.com/view/zhenzhenyan/home). I hold a Ph.D. in Management Science and Engineering from the School of Business, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, and a B.Eng. in Intelligent Transportation Systems from the School of Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University.</span>

<span style="font-size: 1.3em; font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;">My current research interest involves using data-driven optimization, empirical analysis and deep learning tools to tackle challenging logistics and supply chain problems in close collaboration with industry. This line of research has led to the development of the Joint Prediction and Optimization (JPO) system for demand forecasting and inventory control, with beta v1.0 launched on August 29, 2024, for internal use at NUS and in undergraduate teaching. Additionally, I have developed the [LogXHub system](https://appbyjinjiahuang.shinyapps.io/Demo1_DynamicPlanningSystemforCrossDockingOperations_Beta_v9/) to optimize buffer inventory and enhance dynamic cross-docking operations at hubs.</span>

- We study the use of registered volunteers to re-position empty bikes for riders in a bike sharing system.
- We solve a transshipment network design model to account for random route demand and construct a sparse structure that limits volunteer re-balancing to essential routes.
- This provide new insights into the performance of sparse structures in bike re-balancing, showing that concentrating flows reduces redundant moves significantly with minimal impact on demand satisfaction.

[**Research**] <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We develop a novel network design model for repositioning operations, leveraging conic programming and distributionally robust optimization. 
- We provide arguably the first study on constructing sparse networks in decentralized deployment with choice behavior.
- We reveal a paradoxical phenomenon: sometimes, <em> less (choices) can be more (efficient)</em>. We provide new sights into the value of sparse structures.

[**Research**] <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We address the fundamental resource assignment problem faced by hub operators managing multiple services with scheduled starting and completion times, accounting for uncertain delays revealed over time.
- We derive a new insight that conflicts and crossings are equivalent under worst-case delay realization.
- This provides the first theoretical explanation, from the perspective of (distributionally) robust optimization for the good performance of the buffering approach in minimizing both crossings and conflicts in the
operations.

[**Research & Project**] <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span></strong>
- We explore the use of a class of Graph Neural Network (GNN) in modeling and exploiting the correlated demand patterns in multiple time series data. 
- We describe an application of GNN approach on a printer service management problem posed by an industry collaborator.
- This project led to the development of the Joint Prediction and Optimization (JPO) system for demand forecasting and inventory control. The JPO system beta v1.0 was launched on August 29, 2024, for
internal use at NUS and has been used in undergraduate course teaching exercises.
- We provide the novel insight that GNNs might benefit from the data pooling effect inherent to a statistical phenomenon.
